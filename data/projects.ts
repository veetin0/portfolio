 *  1. Append an object to this array. `id`, `name`, `tagline`,
 *     `year`, `domain`, `status`, `summary`, `features`, `stack`
 *     are required — everything else is optional.
 *  2. That's it. The constellation lays it out, the graph wires
 *     up its edges from `stack`, the command palette indexes it,
 *     the terminal can `open` it, and the stack sector counts it.
 *
 *  Nothing below this file needs to change.
